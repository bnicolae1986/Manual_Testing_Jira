1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy, objectives, scope, and approach for testing the “Pagina mea” page of the Didactic.ro application. The “pagina mea” page is a critical component of our application, enabling users to view and manage their personal information, update their settings, and interact with the platform in a personalized manner. Ensuring its functionality, usability, and security is paramount to providing a positive user experience.
1.2 Objectives
The primary objectives of this test plan are:
•	To verify that all features and functionalities work as intended.
•	To ensure the “Pagina mea” page is user-friendly and provides a seamless user experience.
•	To identify and resolve any bugs or issues that may impact the performance, security, or usability
•	To validate the compatibility across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
1.3 Scope
The scope of this test plan includes the following areas of the “Pagina mea” page:
•	User Information: Display and editing of user profile details such as name, email, phone number, profile picture, etc.
•	Account Settings: Access to account settings including password changes, notification preferences, and privacy settings.
•	User Activity: Display of user activity, history, or any relevant logs.
•	Security Features: Verification of secure access and data protection measures.
•	User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Assessment of the UI/UX design, including layout, navigation, and accessibility.
•	Performance: Evaluation of the page's load times, responsiveness, and overall performance under various conditions.
•	Compatibility: Testing across multiple devices, browsers, and operating systems to ensure consistent performance.
1.4 Approach
The testing approach will include a combination of manual and automated testing techniques. The following methodologies will be employed:
•	Functional Testing: To verify that each feature of the “Pagina mea” page functions correctly according to the requirements.
•	Usability Testing: To ensure the page is intuitive and easy to use for end-users.
•	Security Testing: To identify vulnerabilities and ensure the page is secure against potential threats.
•	Performance Testing: To measure the responsiveness and stability of the “Pagina mea” page under different loads.
•	Compatibility Testing: To validate the Profile Page's performance across various devices, browsers, and operating systems.
Test cases will be derived from the detailed requirements and specifications. Each test case will include clear steps to execute, expected results, and criteria for success.
1.5. Test Deliverables
The key deliverables of this test plan will include:
•	Test Cases and Test Scripts: Detailed documents outlining the specific tests to be conducted.
•	Test Execution Reports: Summaries of the results of the testing, including any defects found.
•	Bug Reports: Detailed descriptions of any issues encountered, along with steps to reproduce and potential impact assessments.
•	Final Test Summary Report: A comprehensive overview of the testing outcomes, including metrics, findings, and recommendations.
By following this test plan, we aim to ensure that the “Pagina mea” page is reliable, secure, and user-friendly, providing a high-quality experience for our users.

-	The roles and responsibilities are assigned to the team members.
-	testing environment is up and running

Exit criteria:
-	90% of tests are passed
-	Exploratory testing undertook
-	no Critical issues have Open status
-	update tests are 100% passed (update tests will not generate other new issues that impact the application)
Risks:

2.2 Test analysis 
-	We analyse the business requirements, and make sure we can run all the tests so we can provide the expected results.

2.3 Test design
-	all the test cases are written and reviewed .
2.3 Test design
-	all the test cases are written and reviewed 
2.4 Test implementation 
-	all the test data is available and reviewed (test data= email examples, password examples, different type of currency, different types of credit cards)
-	this test run includes only regression testing in which we will run tests that have the highest priority, this will be main priority
2.5 Test execution
-	the tests will be executed on the top 4 used browsers: Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari. if time will be available we will extend tests on Opera and Brave browsers
2.6 Test closure
-	at least 95% of tests are passed.
-	no Critical issues have Open statu.s
3.	Test conditions
The test conditions will be created based on the business requirements validated in the test analysis phase and will represent the features to be tested and transformed into test cases.
